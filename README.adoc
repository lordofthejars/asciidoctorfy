= Docstract

== What is it?

+docstract+ is an small +java+ project which reads a java source file, extracts the comments between +/**+ and +*/+ sequentially from all over the file and stores them inside an output +AsciiDoc+ file. The idea is not new in fact it is from https://github.com/javaee-samples/javaee7-samples/ developed by _Aslak Knutsen_ but instead of using +Ruby+ and inside +Awestruct+, this project is written in +java+ and it is run from CLI.


Let me show you an example to understand what this application does:

This is a class which contains some comments to be processed.

[source, java]
----
package com.lordofthejars.asciidoctorfy;

/**
 * 
 * My name is *Alex*.
 * I am 33 years _old_.
 * 
 * Jump Jump +!!+.
 *
 * include::src/test/java/com/lordofthejars/asciidoctorfy/MyInterface.java[]
 *
 * include::src/test/java/com/lordofthejars/asciidoctorfy/Project#getId().java[]
 *
 */
public class MM {

	/**
	* It is a *method*.
	*/
	@Test
	public void method() {
		
		
	}
}
----

And the output document looks like:


....
My name is *Alex*.
I am 33 years _old_.

Jump Jump +!!+.

[source, java]
----
public interface MyInterface {

	void loginSuccess(Object hash);
	void loginSuccess();
	void foo(int number, Object block);
	
}
----

[source, java]
----
public String getId() {
	return id;
}
----

It is a *method*.
....

Note that in comments we are also using include macro for inserting files inside. The rules for inclusion are the next ones:

* if include contains a +java+ file, like first example, the whole class is read and inserted within AsciiDoc source code blocks.

* if include contains a +java+ file but with # symbol, like second one, the right part of # will be used as method name of given class. So for example +Project#setId(String, String)+ will include a method of Project's class called +setId+ and receiving two string parameters.

* if include contains an +xml+ file, the file is inserted "as is" within AsciiDoc source code block.

* if include contains an +xml+ file and between brackets there is an +xpath+ expression, the result of that expression will be inserted.

* any other include is left "as is", so it will be processed by +AsciiDoc(tor)+ processor.

Also note that the include files will be resolved relative from place where the CLI is being run, typically from the root of the project.

== Callouts

You can use callouts inside +java+ and +xml+ code and the processor will render it in the proper way.

In +java+ you can write a callout as a single line comment with callout number between _<,>_ at start.

[source, java]
----
public void code() {  
    System.out.println("Hello World"); // <1> Prints Hello World
}
----

In +xml+ you can write callouts between +xml+ comments and the callout number being the first word.

[source, xml]
----
<servers>
    <server>a</server> <!-- 1 defines the server name -->
    <name>b</name>
    <name>c</name>
</servers>
----

== Download

You can grab a runnable jar from https://bintray.com/lordofthejars/generic/Asciidoctorfy/0.1.0/view/files

== Usage

To render previous class we can call as:

....
java -jar docstract-<version>.jar --input=src/test/java/com/lordofthejars/asciidoctorfy/MM.java --output=README.adoc
....

And an +AsciiDoc+ file will be generated from comments blocks.

There is one optional parameter called +--baseDir+. This parameter is used to set the baseDir in include macros. So for example if you set baseDir to +/home/lotj/project+, the include macro will be resolved to +include::/home/lotj/project/src/test/java/....+.

== Live example

You can see an example at community _Tomitribe_ examples with class: https://github.com/tomitribe/community/blob/master/mongodb-example/src/test/java/org/superbiz/nosql/mongodb/GreetingsSessionBeanTest.java and the rendered output: https://github.com/tomitribe/community/blob/master/mongodb-example/README.adoc 

== Collaboration

Next steps will be adding callouts for +xml+ files and adding the possibility to use _<,>_ inside callouts.

New features will be added when they are required but of course feel free to clone and improve it.
